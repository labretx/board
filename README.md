### Svelte
Svelte is a framework for building user interfaces on the web.\
It uses a compiler to turn declarative components written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript into lean, tightly optimized JavaScript.

### Go
The Go programming language is an open source project to make programmers more productive.

Go is expressive, concise, clean, and efficient.\
Its concurrency mechanisms make it easy to write programs that get the most out of multicore and networked machines, while its novel type system enables flexible and modular program construction.\
Go compiles quickly to machine code yet has the convenience of garbage collection and the power of run-time reflection.\
It's a fast, statically typed, compiled language that feels like a dynamically typed, interpreted language.

### Docker
Docker helps developers build, share, run, and verify applications anywhere â€” without tedious environment configuration or management.
